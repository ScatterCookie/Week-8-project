User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to view all posts with options to sort them in ascending or descending order so that I can easily find content based on my preferences.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to design a SQL schema that includes a posts table and a comments table, ensuring that comments are correctly associated with the corresponding post ID.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to delete posts using a delete button on each post’s page so that I can manage or remove my content from the database.
🐿️ As a user, I want to add comments on individual posts using a user-friendly form.
🐿️ As a user, I want to comment on posts directly on their dedicated pages so that my interactions are contextually tied to the content I view.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be automatically redirected to the posts page after creating a new post so I can immediately see my content in the context of all posts.

1. I feel I acheived all the user stories required to complete the tasks as well as atttempting some stretch goals

2.I couldn't get to grips with catagory searching due to the project limitations for catagories

3. I didn't have a blog post scenario, I had a movie DB which allowed people to comment and it posts them in order of posting

DB Schema is in the project as a PNG file
